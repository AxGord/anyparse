# Testing approach

Testing a parser platform is not the same as testing application code. A grammar must behave correctly on inputs its author never thought of, and a writer must produce output that the parser can round-trip. Unit tests alone are insufficient. This document describes the six-layer testing strategy that anyparse adopts.

## The six layers

| # | Layer | Catches | When to add |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **utest unit tests** | Known cases, regressions for specific bugs | From day one |
| 2 | **Golden file tests** | Regressions on large corpora | When a grammar has 20+ sample inputs |
| 3 | **Property round-trip tests** | Writer/parser asymmetries, edge cases no human thought of | With the first grammar |
| 4 | **Cross-family round-trip tests** | Curly-specific leakage into CoreIR | When family IRs exist (Phase 5+) |
| 5 | **Benchmarks** | Performance regressions between commits | When a grammar has a working macro-generated parser |
| 6 | **End-to-end integration tests** | Full pipeline on real-world data | After Phase 2 |

Layers 1, 2, 3 are required from Phase 1 onward. Layers 4, 5, 6 come online as their prerequisites mature.

## Layer 1: utest unit tests

The workhorse. Each test is a small assertion about a specific input-output behavior.

```haxe
function testParsesSimpleObject() {
  var result = JValueParser.parse('{"x":1}');
  Assert.isTrue(JValueTools.equals(
    JObject([{key: "x", value: JNumber(1)}]),
    result
  ));
}
```

**Catches**: regressions on cases that have been thought of. Each fixed bug becomes a test case, preventing regression.

**Does not catch**: cases that nobody considered. A parser can pass all hand-written tests and still fail on something the author never imagined.

Unit test files live in `test/unit/` with one file per component. Test runner is `test/RunTests.hx`.

## Layer 2: Golden file tests

For a grammar with many sample inputs, hand-writing unit test cases becomes tedious. Golden file tests replace assertions with input/output file pairs:

```
test/golden/json/
├── simple_object/
│   ├── input.json
│   └── expected.ast
├── nested/
│   ├── input.json
│   └── expected.ast
├── ...
```

A small test harness walks the directory, parses each `input.*`, serializes the AST, and compares against `expected.ast`. On first run, a `--update-goldens` flag generates `expected.ast` files. On subsequent runs, differences show as diffs in the test output.

**Catches**: regressions on any case in the corpus, even cases added by other developers or downloaded from the internet. Scales to hundreds or thousands of inputs without writing new test code.

**Does not catch**: bugs in cases nobody has added yet.

**Not yet in Phase 1.** Will be added when the first grammar has enough samples to justify the harness (~100 lines of Haxe on top of utest). The user's haxe-formatter fork test corpus is a natural first source of golden files when Phase 3 begins.

## Layer 3: Property round-trip tests

This is the most valuable single category for a parser project. The property is simple:

> For any valid AST, `parse(write(ast)) == ast`.

If this holds on a large number of randomly generated ASTs, the parser and writer are consistent with each other. If it fails, either the writer produces text the parser cannot read, or the parser reads text into a different AST than the writer intended, and the test shows you exactly which AST triggers the failure.

```haxe
function testRandomCases() {
  var rng = new SeededRng(42);
  for (i in 0...200) {
    var ast = randomValue(rng, depth: 4);
    var written = JValueWriter.write(ast);
    var reparsed = JValueParser.parse(written);
    Assert.isTrue(JValueTools.equals(ast, reparsed), 'round-trip failed: ast=$ast, written=$written');
  }
}
```

**Catches**: bugs nobody thought of. The random generator produces cases like "a string with a backslash immediately before a close quote inside an array that is itself the value of a key with special characters" — cases that are incredibly unlikely to be in any hand-written test.

**Does not catch**: bugs on input the writer would never produce. If the parser accepts malformed input that the writer never generates, the round-trip test cannot see it. Layer 1 and Layer 2 cover that gap.

**Seeded generator**: use a seeded PRNG so that failures are reproducible. A failure on seed 42 at iteration 137 should always fail the same way when rerun. No wall-clock-seeded randomness in tests.

**Every grammar gets one**. When a new grammar is added, a round-trip test is part of the pull request. No grammar is "done" until it has passing round-trip tests.

Already in place: `test/unit/JsonRoundTripTest.hx` with ~30 curated cases plus 200 randomly generated ones (both write and parse go through the macro-generated pipeline).

## Layer 4: Cross-family round-trip tests

Specific to the cross-family contract described in `cross-family-contract.md`. Validates that CoreIR has no family-specific assumptions by round-tripping programs through two different family IRs (curly ↔ Lisp) and asserting structural equivalence.

```haxe
function testCurlyLispRoundTrip() {
  var source = "class Point { public var x:Float; public var y:Float; }";
  var ast1 = HaxeParser.parse(source);
  var curlyIr = HaxeAst.toCurlyFamily(ast1);
  var lispIr = CurlyLispBridge.toLisp(curlyIr);
  var clojureAst = LispFamily.toClojure(lispIr);
  var clojureSource = ClojureWriter.write(clojureAst);

  var clojureAst2 = ClojureParser.parse(clojureSource);
  var lispIr2 = ClojureAst.toLispFamily(clojureAst2);
  var curlyIr2 = CurlyLispBridge.toCurly(lispIr2);
  var ast2 = CurlyFamily.toHaxe(curlyIr2);

  Assert.isTrue(AstEquivalence.semanticallyEqual(ast1, ast2));
}
```

**Catches**: any CoreIR primitive that encodes a curly-specific assumption. When the test fails, the bug is in CoreIR (or in one of the family IRs or the bridge), not in the grammar.

**Will be added in Phase 5+** when the first non-curly grammar ships. Until then, the contract is a design-time discipline — every CoreIR primitive proposal gets reviewed with "how does this project onto Lisp?" as a check.

## Layer 5: Benchmarks

Not unit tests. Separate binaries that measure throughput and memory on realistic inputs. The goal is to detect performance regressions between commits and to compare anyparse against the tools it is replacing (haxe-formatter, ax3, native `JSON.parse`).

Benchmarks target each Haxe backend separately because performance differs significantly:
- `bench-neko.hxml` — neko baseline
- `bench-js.hxml` — Node.js
- `bench-hxcpp.hxml` — native

Each benchmark outputs structured JSON with throughput, timing breakdowns, and memory usage. CI collects these and compares against a baseline.

**Benchmarks are not in Phase 1.** They matter starting from Phase 2 when a macro-generated parser has a baseline to measure against. Phase 3 (Haxe formatter) and Phase 4 (AS3 converter) are where benchmarks become critical.

## Layer 6: End-to-end integration tests

Full pipeline tests on real-world data. Take a substantial input (the user's ax3 corpus, a large Haxe project, a corpus of JSON API responses), run it through the full pipeline (parse → transform → write), and compare against an expected output.

**Catches**: interactions between multiple parts of the platform that unit tests miss. Grammars, transforms, writers, and formatters interact in ways that are impossible to cover fully with unit tests.

**Added at Phase 4 onwards**, specifically for the AS3→Haxe conversion replacing ax3. The user's ~2000-file corpus is the canonical integration test: the new tool must produce equivalent Haxe output on every file, ideally faster than ax3 and without JVM.

## Mutation checks: testing the tests

The six layers all answer the same question from different angles: does the code do what it is supposed to do? A mutation check asks the inverted question: if the code *stopped* doing it, would anything go red?

That question has to be asked separately, because a green suite is not evidence that the suite covers anything. A mechanism can be exercised by no fixture at all and still sit inside a passing run — every test that touches the file happens to take another branch, or asserts on a property the mechanism does not affect. The suite reports success, the coverage number looks fine, and the mechanism is a vacuum: it can be deleted, inverted, or quietly broken by an unrelated refactor and nothing will say so. The only reliable way to find such a vacuum is to break the mechanism on purpose and watch what the suite does.

### The runner

```sh
tools/mutation-check.sh <manifest> [--jobs N]
```

Each *track* in the manifest is one deliberate breakage. The runner gives every track its own git worktree checked out from `HEAD`, applies the track's patch there, builds a private test runner into a private workdir (`tools/worker-build.sh`, see "Parallel tracks" below), runs the requested slice of the suite with the CWD set to that worktree, and classifies the transcript. Tracks run in parallel; `--jobs` defaults to `max(1, min(4, cores/2))`, and an explicit `--jobs` must evaluate to a positive integer (`0` — and `00`, and any other spelling of zero — is rejected rather than clamped, since `xargs -P 0` means unbounded).

Because worktrees come from `HEAD`, uncommitted work in the main tree is invisible to a track. That is deliberate — a track measures a named commit plus one patch, not whatever happens to be lying around — but it means a mutation aimed at uncommitted code has to be committed first, or folded into the patch.

### Manifest format

Line-oriented, `|`-separated, four fields, whitespace around fields trimmed. Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.

```
<name> | <patch-file> | <APQ_TEST filter> | <expected>[,<expected>...]
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Track id, `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`, unique in the manifest. Names the worktree directory and the report row. |
| `patch` | A git patch — literally `git diff` output — applied with `git apply` inside the worktree. Resolved relative to the **manifest's own directory** (absolute paths pass through), so a manifest and its patches move as one bundle. |
| `filter` | Required, non-empty. Passed as `APQ_TEST`. The literal word `ALL` runs the whole suite with `APQ_TEST` unset. |
| `expected` | Comma-separated substrings, may be empty. Each is matched against the collected failure names, which have the form `<fq.ClassName>.<testMethod>`. |

The patch is a `git diff` rather than a script or a sed expression because the worktree is created from `HEAD`: a diff taken against `HEAD` applies there deterministically, and authoring a track needs no new tooling. Break the mechanism in the main tree, `git diff > x.patch`, revert, add a manifest line.

**Give every track a narrow `APQ_TEST` filter.** A track with `ALL` pays the entire suite for one mutation, and drags in cases whose outcome depends on the environment rather than on the mutation — most notably the corpus harness, which only runs when `ANYPARSE_HXFORMAT_FORK` is set. A filter naming the one or two classes that are supposed to catch the breakage keeps a track at seconds and keeps its verdict about the mutation.

### Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SURVIVED` | The run came back **green** — utest's own `results: ALL TESTS OK (success: true)`. **This is the finding the tool exists for.** |
| `KILLED` | The run went red, and every expectation matched something. No expectations given means any red kills. |
| `MISMATCH` | The run went red, but at least one expectation matched nothing — the suite noticed, just not where the track claimed it would. |
| `NO-TESTS` | The filter matched no test class. Loud on purpose: a typo'd filter otherwise reads as `SURVIVED`. |
| `WT-FAIL` | `git worktree add` failed — there was nothing to patch or run. |
| `PATCH-FAIL` | `git apply` failed. Manifest or patch defect. |
| `BUILD-FAIL` | The patched tree does not compile. A mutation the compiler rejects proves nothing about the suite. |
| `RUN-FAIL` | No usable transcript, or a red header whose result rows the parser could not name. |

`SURVIVED` is deliberately stricter than "nothing failed". utest computes `isOk = !(hasFailures || hasErrors || hasWarnings)`, and it auto-adds a `Warning('no assertions')` to any test method that completes without asserting. So a mutation that makes a test stop asserting produces `failures: 0, warnings: 3` and a red run — which a scan for `FAILURE`/`ERROR` rows alone would have reported as a survivor, in the one direction where a wrong answer costs the most. The verdict therefore comes from the header line, and the per-class rows are used only to *name* what went red. A marker this parser does not recognise leaves a red run unnamed, which surfaces as `RUN-FAIL`, never as `SURVIVED`.

Failures *beyond* the expectations do not demote `KILLED` to `MISMATCH`; they are listed on the row as `+extra: …`. A track asks whether the suite notices, and a wider blast radius still answers yes — the extras are reported because they are useful signal about coupling, not because they are a defect.

Exit code: 0 only when every track is `KILLED`. Any other verdict exits 1, so a manifest can guard a mechanism in CI.

The report is one row per track in manifest order, followed by a summary and the workroot path:

```
KILLED     doc-blockonly        filter=SetDoc         2 tests failed / 40 assertions: unit.SetDocSliceTest.testX, unit.SetDocSliceTest.testY
SURVIVED   dead-branch          filter=HxLexer        0 tests failed / 85 assertions
MISMATCH   foo                  filter=Bar            2 tests failed / 9 assertions: … (missing: unit.BazTest)
3 tracks: 1 killed, 1 survived, 1 mismatch, 0 error
```

The two figures on a row are in different units on purpose: the count of failing *test methods* against the total *assertions* utest reported, since that total is the only run-size figure the header carries — once a run goes red utest stops listing the passing tests, so there is no test-level total to divide by. The name list is capped at the first ten, with `…+N more`; the full set is in the track's transcript, which the workroot path points at.

Every worktree the runner created is removed on exit, including on `INT`/`TERM`/`HUP`. A `worktree remove` that itself fails is swallowed so one bad entry cannot strand the rest — which does mean a stuck worktree can survive as a registered entry, so `git worktree list` is worth a glance after a crashed run. The workroot itself is never deleted: its transcripts, build logs and verdict files are the post-mortem. They accumulate in `TMPDIR` across a long campaign, so a campaign that runs for days is worth sweeping by hand.

## Macro-specific tests

anyparse is a macro-heavy project. Macros have three test shapes:

### Compile-time smoke test

Does the macro compile a grammar without errors? This is a CI step that tries to compile tests/macro-samples/*.hx and fails if any do not compile. Catches macro regressions that break compilation.

### Generated code inspection

Does the macro generate the expected code for a given grammar? This is done by invoking the macro in test context and inspecting the output `haxe.macro.Expr`. Rarely needed, but essential when debugging a tricky codegen bug.

### Macro failure tests

Does the macro report a sensible error on invalid input? If a user writes `@:infix(prec=5)` without `@:op`, the macro should produce a specific error message, not a mysterious internal failure. A test asserts that compiling an invalid grammar fails with an expected error substring.

Not in Phase 1 since there is no macro yet. Will appear with Phase 2.

## Test framework: utest 1.13.x

Chosen over tink_unittest and buddy for reasons of:
- Being the most popular Haxe unit test framework, lowering friction for contributors.
- No tink dependency, keeping anyparse's dependency tree empty at runtime.
- Clean integration with Haxe macros and compile-time metadata.

Test cases extend `utest.Test`, assertions use `utest.Assert`. Each test method begins with `test`.

## Guidelines for new tests

### Test names describe what they assert

Bad: `testCase1`, `testParsing`.
Good: `testParsesSimpleObject`, `testRejectsUnclosedArray`.

The test name is the first thing a failure report shows. A name that communicates intent saves debugging time.

### One concept per test

A test method asserting five different things has five potential failure sites that all look the same in the report. Split into five tests with specific names.

### No test depends on another

Tests must be order-independent. utest may run them in any order. No shared mutable state between tests.

### Assertions include context

When `Assert.equals(expected, actual)` fails, the default message shows only the values. When context is useful, add a label:

```haxe
Assert.equals(expected, actual, 'failed at iteration $i with ast $ast');
```

Especially valuable in property tests where the failure is hidden in random data.

### New grammars get round-trip tests by default

When adding a grammar, the PR includes a round-trip test with at least 20 curated cases and a random generator that produces 100+ cases per run. A grammar without a round-trip test is not ready to merge.

## Running tests

```sh
haxe test.hxml          # neko, fastest compile+run (default)
haxe test-js.hxml       # js/node, for cross-platform validation
haxe test-interp.hxml   # Haxe macro interpreter, no compile step
```

`test.hxml` and `test-interp.hxml` are self-contained (no compile-server
dependency). `test-server.hxml` / `test-interp-server.hxml` add
`--connect 7822` as an opt-in speed path for a dedicated compile server
(`haxe --wait 7822`, once) — only use them when a compatible server
from this checkout is actually listening, since a stray or mismatched
server on that port answers `--connect` without error and silently
skips the build (exit 0, no artifact produced, no output).

When Phase 2 adds hxcpp as a target:

```sh
haxe test-hxcpp.hxml    # native binary, slowest compile but closest to production
```

All targets must pass before a commit. Cross-target failures usually indicate a platform-specific issue that should be fixed, not ignored.

### Parallel tracks: per-worker build outputs

`bin/apq.js` and `bin/test.js` are single shared artifacts. That is fine for one person at a keyboard and actively hostile to several agents working the repo at once: every build truncates the binary the others are executing, so a second worker cannot even run a probe while the first is compiling. The parallelism is lost before it starts, and the failures it produces look like flaky tests rather than like a build race.

The fix is to stop sharing the artifact:

```sh
tools/worker-build.sh /tmp/w1              # builds /tmp/w1/apq.js and /tmp/w1/test.js
tools/worker-build.sh /tmp/w1 test         # just the test runner
node /tmp/w1/test.js                       # instead of node bin/test.js
APQ_TEST=RemoveParam node /tmp/w1/test.js
HXQ_BIN=/tmp/w1/apq.js hxq ast Foo.hx      # every hxq subcommand, queries and mutation ops alike
```

`HXQ_BIN` points the `hxq` shim at an explicit engine and, as a consequence, skips the shared stale-check and auto-rebuild entirely — the worker owns its own build, so the shim must not decide to rebuild `bin/apq.js` underneath it. The two builds inside `worker-build.sh` run concurrently, and it resolves the repo from its own location rather than from the CWD, so a copy of the script living inside a git worktree builds *that* worktree's `src/`.

Some tests read paths relative to the CWD (`bin/.last-sweep.json`, `test/` fixtures, `hxformat.json`, `apqlint.json`), so run a private `test.js` with the CWD set to the tree it was built from.

Two limits worth stating plainly, because a private engine invites more confidence than it earns:

- **Builds, test runs and probes become parallel; the source tree does not.** Two agents running mutating ops on the same files still need coordination — a private engine isolates the *tool*, not the files it edits. Genuine source isolation means a git worktree per worker, which is what `tools/mutation-check.sh` does.
- **A private engine is a snapshot.** It goes stale the moment another agent lands a `src/` change, and unlike the shared shim path nothing will warn you. Rebuild your own before trusting a probe.

The build flags live in `bin/apq-js-common.hxml` and `test-js-common.hxml`, with the output line split out into the leaf files `bin/apq-js.hxml` and `test-js.hxml`. That split exists because Haxe rejects a second `-js` with `Error: Multiple targets` — an hxml that already names an output cannot be retargeted by a later `-js` on the command line, so the shared part must not name one. Note that a bare hxml-include line is resolved against the CWD, not against the including file's directory: build from the repo root.
