/**
 * Plugin-declared contract for `apq refs`. The walker reads these
 * slots and never inspects grammar-specific node types.
 *
 * `identKind` is the `QueryNode.kind` value the plugin produces for a
 * bare identifier reference (e.g. `'IdentExpr'` for Haxe). Each such
 * node contributes its `name` slot as a candidate reference.
 *
 * `declHostKinds` is the set of node kinds whose own `name` slot is a
 * binding declaration — variables, functions, parameters, types. The
 * walker emits each matching node as a `decl` hit. Decl-host detection
 * takes precedence over identifier detection when a kind appears in
 * both sets.
 *
 * `scopeKinds` is the set of node kinds that introduce a fresh lexical
 * scope (function body, block, for-loop, class body, …). The walker
 * pushes a new frame on entering one of these and pops on exit;
 * declarations inside the frame shadow same-named bindings in
 * enclosing frames. A kind can simultaneously be a scope-introducer,
 * a decl-host, and an ident — the three roles are orthogonal.
 *
 * `writeParentKinds` is the set of node kinds whose first positional
 * child, when an `identKind` node, is a write target rather than a
 * read. The walker reclassifies that child's hit from `Read` to
 * `Write`. The "first positional child" rule is intentional and
 * implicit — sufficient for assign-style ctors in curly-brace
 * grammars (e.g. `Assign(left, right)`, `AddAssign(left, right)`)
 * where the LHS is the binding being modified. Nested LHS shapes
 * (`FieldAccess`, `IndexAccess`, paren-wrapped, etc.) deliberately
 * do not trigger a Write reclassification on inner identifiers —
 * those inner identifiers remain Reads, which matches semantic
 * expectation (`arr[i] = v` reads `arr` and `i`, writes `arr[i]`;
 * `obj.x = 1` reads `obj`, writes `obj.x`).
 *
 * Phase 3.3 scope: write classification via parent-kind context.
 * Compound assignments (`x += 1`) are classified as `Write` —
 * `RefKind` carries one classification per hit; the read-then-write
 * semantics of compound assigns folds into the `--writes` query
 * intent. Plugin-contract enrichment for transparent-struct decl
 * sites (3.2b) layers on top without breaking this shape.
 *
 * `selfScopeDeclKinds` (Phase 3.2b-α) is the set of scope-introducer
 * kinds whose own `name` slot is a binding declared into THEIR OWN
 * scope frame — the iterator/parameter-on-the-scope-node pattern (Haxe
 * `for (i in xs) …`). Such a kind emits a `Decl` hit (self-bound, like
 * `declHostKinds`) but, unlike `declHostKinds`, the binding is visible
 * only *inside* the construct: a read of `i` after the loop does NOT
 * resolve to it. This is the opposite of `declHostKinds`, where the
 * name binds into the *enclosing* frame and is visible to siblings
 * (function / type names). A kind here must also appear in `scopeKinds`
 * (the walker only self-declares when it pushes a frame) and must NOT
 * appear in `declHostKinds` (the two bind into different frames).
 * Catch-clause and lambda-parameter bindings are NOT covered — they
 * sit on transparent typedef-structs that carry no runtime span, so a
 * correct per-clause/per-param binding span is deferred (3.2b-β).
